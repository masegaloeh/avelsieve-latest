<h2>Devel Series (1.9.x)</h2>

<h3><a name="1.9.2">1.9.2 beta - Devel Branch (??/12/2004)</a></h3>

<ul>

<li>Descriptive text for Notify action (short version) now shows the
destination address.</li>

</ul>


<h3><a name="1.9.1">1.9.1 beta - Devel Branch (22/12/2004)</a></h3>

<ul>

<li>Fix off-by-one serious error in MANAGESIEVE class. The bug could DoS the
Apache server by getting PHP into an endless loop. <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1000027&group_id=35727&atid=415051">(Sourceforge
Bug Tracker Link)</a></li>

<li>Corrected handling of Whitelist values in SPAM Rule. Previously, in
Advanced SPAM Rule Creation, a SPAM Rule that had no effect could be created
because a wrong whitelist value would be enabled. This fix also improved the
GUI behavior (<span class="bugreporter">Nikos Voutsinas</span>).</li>

<li>The <a href="http://sieve-php.sourceforge.net">sieve-php</a>(MANAGESIEVE)
class can now handle REFERALS (patch by <span class="contributor">Michael
Loftis</span>).</li>

<li>Added Mailing-List to the default headers select box, as suggested by
Florin Andrei.</li>

<li>Made some input textboxes handle larger text (changed maxlength).</li>

<li>Enabled STOP by default in new SPAM rule.</li>

<li>Do not use function call-time pass-by-reference, for better compatibility
with PHP4/5.</li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="1.9.0">1.9.0 alpha - Devel Branch (22/11/2004)</a></h3>

<ul>

<li>New feature: A mail filtering rule can be created on-the-fly while reading
a message in Squirrelmail. The algorithm is similar to other <acronym
title="Mail User Agents">MUAs</acronym>: First a check is done if the mail
belongs to a mailing list, then a check on the sender and destination
addresses, and lastly the Subject is taken into account.</li>

<li>The <em>Edit Rule</em> page has been redesigned. Specifically:</li>
	
	<ul>
	<li>The type of rule (size match, header match etc.) can be changed
	on-the-fly.</li>
	
	<li>Action Options are displayed only when the relevant action has been
	selected.</li>

	<li>On-the-fly new folder creation now works properly, with better error
	handling.</li>

	<li>The page takes into account user's preferences on new popup windows and
	javascript options.</li>

	</ul>

<li>The <em>Edit Rule</em> page can now add a new rule.</li>

<li>The <em>Add new Rule Wizard</em> has been obsoleted by the revamped
<em>Edit Rule</em> page.</li>

<li>Completely rewritten a lot of the code that handles the GUI parts of
avelsieve. The code is written in a way so that new GUI frontends can be
written a bit more easily.</li>

<li>The &quot;More...&quot; button in Spam Rule Whitelist now adds items
properly.</li>

<li>As always, code cleanups all around.</li>

</ul>

<li>Spam Rule Functionality can be configured to get the RBLs from Sendmail's

<li>Non-conservative mode has been made available again. Set $conservative =
false, to remove the &quot;Save Changes&quot; complexity and to save any

to work.</li>

<li>Added doc/INSTALL.</li>

</ul>



<h3>0.9.7</h3>

<ul>

<li>New option for a special rule called &quot;SPAM Rule&quot;. Allows for easy
addition of an Anti-SPAM rule. Advanced configuration allows for setting the
desired score, the SPAM lists to check against and the desired action. Actions
are: Move to Junk Folder (if <a
href="http://www.squirrelmail.org/plugin_view.php?id=212">Junk Folder
plugin</a> is enabled), Move to Trash, Discard. Administrator Configuration

<li>Notification ID has been commented since it's not in use currently.</li>

<li>Added GIF images for Internet Explorer compatibility. IE cannot handle PNG
transparency normally.</li>

href="https://bugzilla.andrew.cmu.edu/show_bug.cgi?id=2135">not supported by
Cyrus yet</a>.</li>

<li>Fixed tools URL so as not to end in &amp;, since some proxys complain for
invalid URL (<span class="bugreporter">Simon Matter</span>)</li>

<li>Locale bug fixes (<span class="bugreporter">Karsten Behrens</span>)</li>

down widget.</li>

<li>When editing a rule with notification action, the saved notification
parameters will be displayed correctly. (<span class="bugreporter">Chris
Winterrowd</span>)</li>

</ul>




<h3>0.9.6 (29/9/2003)</h3>

<ul>

<li>Scripts are properly encoded in UTF-8. Backward compatibility with previous
versions is preserved -- if version &lt; 0.9.6, no decoding is done. (Thanks to
<span class="contributor">Tomas Kuliavas</span> for his help).</li>

<li>Information about creation date and last modification date of the script is
displayed.</li>

<li>Support for imapproxy; if you enable the new option <em>imapproxymode</em>
in config.php, you can also define a mapping from the imapproxy server (usually
localhost) to the real IMAP/SIEVE server, since imapproxy cannot understand
MANAGESIEVE.</li>

<li>Bugfix: The last rule can be deleted normally again. (Broken in 0.9.5).
Thanks to <span class="bugreporter">Joseph Tate</span>.</li>

<li>Supports the <a
href="http://email.uoa.gr/projects/squirrelmail/authorization.php">different
authentication &amp; authorization patch</a>, i.e.  displays the script of the
authorized user.</li>

<li>SASL PLAIN in sieve-php.lib.php has been fixed so as to correctly pass the
authorization identity.</li>

<li>You can enable AVELSIEVE_DEBUG mode in table.php, for troubleshooting and
debugging avelsieve easily.</li>

</ul>

<p>Mostly a bugfix release.</p>

<ul>

<li>Now escaping of \ and &quot; are done properly.</li>

script.</li>

<li>When wrong (non-parsable) script is created, the script can be displayed
for debugging purposes and to help send me a bug report so as to fix it!
Uncomment the relevant lines in sieve.php, line #62, to enable this.</li>

<li>Fixed &quot;Move to bottom&quot; functionality (<span
class="bugreporter">Simon Matter</span>)

<li>Some more minor bug fixes.</li>

<li>Updated Spanish translation (<span class="translator">Eduardo
Mayoral</span>)</li>

<li>Updated Greek translation.</li>

</ul>



<h3>0.9.4 (1/9/2003)</h3>

<p>Note: Since there are some changes in the configuration file, I suggest that
you <strong>use the supplied config.php file</strong> and import back any
changes you have made afterwards.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Security Bug Fixed. Upgrading to version
0.9.4 is strongly encouraged.</strong> Thanks to <span
class="contributor">&quot;David F. Madrid&quot;</span> for bringing the problem
to my attention.</li>

<li>Avelsieve version information is stored in the SIEVE script, for backward
compatibility reasons.</li>

<li>If the user is using identities, all her email addresses are displayed in
the vacation input box. (<span class="contributor"><a
href="mailto:pascal.schelcher &#64; vecteurplus.com">Pascal
Schelcher</a></span>) <small>[Previously this would work only when LDAP Prefs
Backend was enabled]</small></li>

<li>Added configuration option to force-disable certain SIEVE capabilities, so
as not to be displayed in the GUI. For instance, you can disable the display of
notify or vacation options, even though timsieved supports (&amp; advertises)
them. (Idea inspired by <span class="bugreporter">Chris Winterrowd</span>)</li>

<li>Added config option for preferred SASL authentication mechanisms to
use.</li>

<li>Added move to top / bottom functionality in the rules table, so as to
quickly reorder the rules.</li>

<li>Removed obsolete and incomplete image themes; now there are two complete
themes: Plain-Bluecurve style (16x16) and GTK-BlueCurve style (24x24), the
latter being the default.</li>

<li>Created interface for new &quot;tools&quot; (along with create, duplicate,
edit etc.) to be created easily: function avelsieve_print_toolicon()</li>

<li>Formalized code comments and brought them up to date; now using
Javadoc-style comments.</li>

<li>When editing an existing rule, notify method is displayed correctly.</li>

<li>Added Romanian translation (<span class="translator">Marius
Onica</span>)</li>

<li>Lots of code cleanups.</li>

</ul>


<h3>0.9.3 (1/8/2003)</h3>


<ul>

<li>GUI issue resolved; when choosing to create a new folder or when selecting
an existing folder, the corresponding radio button is selected
automatically.</li>


<li>Added translation to Lithuanian, by <span class="translator">Tomas
Kuliavas</span></li>

<li>Added translation to Brazilian Portuguese, by <span
class="translator">Gleydson Mazioli da Silva</span></li>

<li>Updated German translation (<span class="translator">Karsten
Behrens</span>)</li>

<li>Updated Finnish translation (<span class="translator">Veli
Pirttila</span>)</li>

<li>Added version information per Squirrelmail plugins guidelines.</li>

</ul>


<h3>0.9.2 (9/6/2003)</h3>

<ul>

<li>Error handling in the creation of a new folder whilst adding a new rule has
been reenabled, and greatly enhanced with some pretty error checking &amp;
handling.</li>

<li>While editing a rule, the fileinto folder option looks nicer.</li>

<li>Removed the dependancy of sieve-php.lib on extension mhash.so, if
DIGEST-MD5 is used. Many thanks to <span class="contributor"><a
href="mailto:tassium &#64; squirrelmail org">Chris Hilts</a></span>!</li>

<li>Updated .po file problems, and merged them with the new strings that have
appeared around the code. Also introduced translation statistics to keep track
of the translations.</li>

</ul>


<h3>0.9.1 (30/5/2003)</h3>

<ul>

<li>Buggy backward-compatibility code was removed. Now Squirrelmail 1.4 is a
requirement.</li>

<li>Bugfix release, moving to a stable and bug free (hopefully)
1.0-<em>&quot;final&quot;</em>.</li>

<li>At last, 100% register_globals=off compatible!</li>

<li>At long last, 100% error_reporting=E_ALL compatible! (Or 99%, until version
1.0).</li>

<li>Alternative sieve-php.lib is provided, for the people who don't want the
dependancy on mhash.so. (Please provide a patch if you'd like some nicer
way).</li>

<li>Problems with a table with no filters being displayed instead of the
introductory message were fixed once more.</li>

<li>Localization issues for these messages have been taken care of.</li>

<li>Now vacation email is always set by default. If user does not specify email
addresses, Squirrelmail's From: Address is used. Handling of email addresses
was fixed. If the LDAP prefs backend (ldapuserdata plugin) is used, it can be
configured to get all addresses from the LDAP attributes mail and
mailAlternateAddress.</li>

<li>Creating a new folder when adding a new rule has been temporarily disabled.
Will be reenabled in 0.9.2.</li>

<li>When editing an existing rule, notify parameters are displayed and saved
correctly.</li>

<li>Switching between verbose and terse mode is now saved correctly (for the
session).</li>

<li>Added Norwegian translation (<span class="translator">Alexander
Brill</span>)</li>

<li>Added Icelandic translation (<span class="translator">&THORN;&oacute;r
Sigur&eth;sson</span>)</li>

<li>Updated Greek translation (<span class="translator">Alexandros
Vellis</span>).</li>

</ul>



<h3>0.9 (23/4/2003)</h3>

<ul>

<li>Made it Squirrelmail 1.4.x-compatible again! (My compatibility code seems
to break compatibility :-/ )</li>

<li>Various small fixes and cleanups.</li>

<li>This is the last &quot;stable&quot; version, and the last one to support
Squirrelmail 1.2.x. From now on, please either upgrade to Squirrelmail 1.4.x or
use the compatibility plugin.</li>


</ul>



<h3>0.9pre5 (25/2/2003)</h3>

<ul>

<li>Made it Squirrelmail 1.2.x-compatible again; it now includes Squirrelmail's

inconvenience!</li>

</ul>


<h3>0.9pre4 (25/2/2003)</h3>


<ul>

<li>Bug fix: When entering the Filters screen for the first time, a table with
an empty line was produced for the first time... (<span
class="bugreporter">Daniel Henninger</span>)</li>

<li>Renamed support.php so as to avoid conflicts with twc_weather plugin (<span
class="bugreporter">Ryan Press</span>)</li>

<li>Forgot to remove debugging code in 0.9pre3...</li>

<li>Fixed session problems; now uses Squirrelmail's session functions from
global.php</li>

<li>Simplified and deleted a lot of code by removing the option for
non-conservative connections</li>

<li>Added partial greek translation.</li>

</ul>

<h3>0.9pre3 (21/1/2003)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Supports  <a
href="http://www.cyrusoft.com/sieve/drafts/sieve-notify-01.txt">Sieve - notify
extension</a></li>
<li>Updated French Translation (<span class="translator">John Cotter</span>)</li>

</ul>

<h3>0.9pre2 (11/12/2002)</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Works with register_globals = Off!</strong></li>

<li><strong>Works with Squirrelmail 1.3.2+ !</strong>. Uses SM_PATH and
friends.</li>

<li>Backward-compatible with Squirrelmail 1.2 (does version checking).</li>

<li>New way to display the description of a rule: either verbose (as
previously) or terse. The display mode is saved in a session.</li>

<li>Now supports <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-murchison-sieve-regex-06.txt">Sieve
regexp extension</a>.</li>

<li><em>Delete Selected Rules</em> now works correctly!</li>

<li>Fixed the newlines in the vacation message (from \n to \r\n) and made it
support multi-line text as well. (<span class="contributor">Christian
Schneider</span>, <span class="bugreporter">Martin Schipany</span>).</li>

<li>Translation of the messages returned by the <em>Reject</em> and
<em>Vacation</em> actions is now configurable in config.php, and turned off by
default (i.e. predefined messages are in English). You can turn it back on, if
you are on an intranet environment or somewhere you know most communication is
happening in the same language.</li>

<li>A lot of small bug fixes, code cleanups, HTML cleanups.</li>

</ul>



<h3>0.9pre1 (19/11/2002)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Supports the <em>matches</em> wildcard glob-style operator for header
matches (many thanks to <span class="contributor"><a
href="cschneid_at_cschneid.com">Christian Schneider</a></span> for his code!).

<li>Also supports various <a
href="http://www.oceana.com/ftp/drafts/draft-segmuller-sieve-relation-01.txt">Sieve
relational tests</a> for the header match, like <em>greater than or equal
to</em> etc. Also added some headers like X-Priority: and X-Spam-Flag: (credits
to <span class="contributor">Mathias Homann</span> for this one ;))</li>

<li>A new option to keep a message flagged as deleted in user's inbox. (<span
class="contributor"><a href="cschneid_at_cschneid.com">Christian
Schneider</a></span>).</li>

<li>sieve-php.lib was patched so that various SIEVE extensions are now detected
automatically. So, if an implementation does not support vacation, this
functionality will not appear to the user. The capabilities supported so far
are: fileinto, reject, vacation, imapflags, relational. Also, body and regexp
will be supported soon!  </li>

<li>In the rules table, a &quot;Delete Selected Rules&quot; button together
with the checkboxes is now available (although a bit buggy!). Also the code got
much more simplified and cleaned up.</li>

<li>Started implementing <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-degener-sieve-body-00.txt">SIEVE:
Body Extension</a>.</li>

config.php).</li>

</ul>

<h3>0.8pre7 (8/10/2002)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fix for $items handling - made that superglobal too. The header match
screen should display properly now. (<span class="bugreporter">Bjoern T
Johansen</span>)</li>

<li>i18n fix for installations that use Squirrelmail's gettext hack instead of
PHP's gettext module (<span class="bugreporter">Stefan Rapp</span>).</li>

</ul>


<h3>0.8pre6 (4/10/2002)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Added translation to simplified Chinese, by <span class="contributor">
<a href="jack&#64;gaofamily.org">Jack Gao</a></span></li>
<li>Locale and gettext fixes (<span class="bugreporter">Torsten
Westermann</span>).</li>
</ul>


<h3>0.8pre5 (30/9/2002)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Major new feature: A rule can now be edited.</li>

<li>Major rework on the appearance. Now all the pages look even better, and
more like the rest of the Squirrelmail interface.</li>

<li>Added checkbox widgets, so that many rules can be deleted at once.</li>

<li>Now uses superglobal arrays everywhere (e.g. _$SESSION instead of the
deprecated $HTTP_SESSION_VARS). Possibly works with register_globals turned
off (not yet tested).</li>

<li>Renamed files from '.inc' to '.php', for security reasons and
consistency.</li>

<li>User-interface cleanups, more friendly messages when a rule has been
deleted, added or updated.</li>

<li>Miscellaneous other code cleanups.</li>

</ul>


<h3>0.7 -- Skipped (6/2002)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fixed the style sheet in addrule.php. Now it looks just like the rest of
the Squirrelmail interface - it uses the same header. This hopefully fixes the
layout on some pages in konqueror (kde3.0.1) and Netscape 6. (<span
class="bugreporter">Torsten Westermann</span> for the idea).</li>

<li>Bugfix: spare quote in addrule_html.inc was deleted. Now the Clear this
form button works in konqueror. (<span class="bugreporter">Torsten
Westermann</span>) </li>

<li>Added spanish translation by <span class="contributor">
<a href="mailto:emayoral&#64;arsys.es">Eduardo Mayoral </a></span>.</li>

<li>Translations and gettext bug fixes. Now the localization should work
normally, everywhere. Hopefully. Fixed the &quot;The header&quot; string.</li>

<li>More path and cwd fixes. Now everything is chdir'ed to plugins/ as it
should be.</li>

<li>Bugfix: the locale .mo files need not be copied to the global locale
dir.</li>

<li>Folders drop-down widgets have been changed to show a tabbed view of the
tree and to support modified-UTF-7-encoded folder names, for international
folder names.</li>

</ul>


<h3>0.6 (29/5/2002)</h3>

<ul>

<li>New feature: When adding a new header rule, at step 2 a user can define
many <em>if</em> statements, which will all be ANDed or ORed. The GUI was
sorted out as well. Rows of statements can be added or removed dynamically with
submit buttons. The maximum number of statements inside the rule, as well as
the starting number of statements and the headers to display in the listbox,
are now all administrator-definable, in config.php. </li>

<li>Added i18n hooks and support for gettext.</li>

<li>Added german translation by <span class="contributor"> Torsten
Westermann</span>.</li>

<li>Added russian translation by <span class="contributor">
<a href="mailto:vadATtomsknetDOTru">Vadim Kozlov</a></span>.</li>

<li>Added Features, bugs sections in documentation.</li>


</ul>

<h3>0.5 (19/4/2002)</h3>


<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that triggered when a user decided to click somewhere else
(e.g. on a folder in the folder list frame) when adding a rule, and then wanted
to come back and add a rule.</li>

<li>Fixed another bug having to do with strange chdir()s (again). Strange that
these don't occur in <em>my</em> PHP installation. Thanks to <span
class="bugreporter">Martin</span> (no further info ;-)).</li>

<li>Added GNOME themes for the icons.</li>

<li>Changed status to beta. :)</li>
</ul>

<h3>0.4 (4/4/2002)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fixed the hook function name. Thanks to <span class="bugreporter">Nick
Sayer</span> for reporting this.</li>

<li>Fixed (hopefully) a bug that appeared when user deleted all the rules.
Apparently, a script with just a require line was created. Again, thanks to
<span class="bugreporter">Nick Sayer</span>.</li>

<li>Fixed a small chdir problem in table.php. Thanks to <span
class="bugreporter">Stephane Bonnell</span> and <span class="bugreporter">Claus
Nielsen</span>.</li>

<li>Changed the overall behaviour: no more if { ... } elseif {... } else {
...}. Now, every rule is in its own if block. Also added the option to stop
processing any rules. This means that the default rule stuff is now obsolete.
So, now <em>every</em> rule is checked against, until the end of the script or
until a stop statement is found. (<span class="contributor">David
Mendenhall</span>)</li>

<li>Instead of a default rule (aka else statement), one can select &quot;All
Messages&quot; in the rule type (step 1), thus defining an &quot;if
(true)&quot; rule that will apply everywhere. (<span class="contributor">David
Mendenhall</span>)</li>

<li>Added vacation functionality. (<span class="contributor">David
Mendenhall</span>)</li>

<li>Added the options &quot;does not contain&quot; and &quot;is not&quot;,
along with their positive counterparts, in the header match if clause. (<span
class="contributor">David Mendenhall</span>)</li>

<li>Eye candy: Added images for the move up / move down / delete buttons. It is
even themable (from an administrator's point of view ANW).</li>

<li>Add the option to create a new folder &quot;on the fly&quot;, when adding a
new rule (in step 3). The error handling, though, is very poor.  Therefore,
this feature is for testing only - and disabled by default in config.php.</li>

<li>The text at some places is nicer and more user-friendly. (<span
class="contributor">David Mendenhall</span>)</li>

<li>Prevent wrapping on the options column in table.php.</li>

<li>Added a STOP icon in step 3 of addrule.php. ;)</li>

<li>Removed obsolete files htmlprint.inc and htmlfunc2.inc. Somehow they
survived. :-)</li>

<li>Added gray_plain theme. (<span class="contributor">David
Mendenhall</span>)</li>

</ul>

<h3>0.3</h3>

<ul>

<li>Introduced an option to be conservative on the connections to SIEVE daemon.
Uses cached variables in the PHP session, but requires the user to
logout after she's done with her changes. This feature is still under
development.</li>
<li>Move Up / Move Down functionality in the rules table.</li>
<li>Added config.php for setting options.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that triggered when one pressed Cancel while adding a rule,
and then tried to add another rule.</li>
<li>Some code cleanup in table.php. Debug messages that showed up are now
hidden. Made the function upload_script().</li>
<li>The integration with SM is just a little better; the theme colors are
now taken into account, in both table.php and addrule.php. :-)</li>

</ul>

<h3>0.2</h3>
<ul>

<li>Added &quot;default rule&quot; functionality, that is, the much
anticipated &quot;else&quot; clause. :-) If not used, the default remains
SIEVE's <em>implicit keep</em>, i.e. fileinto INBOX, accordingly to
the SIEVE RFC. </li>
<li>Miscellaneous code cleanup -- it's still pretty much a mess though.</li>
<li>Added it to the official <a
href="http://www.squirrelmail.org/plugins.php">Squirrelmail plugins
site</a>.</li> </ul>


<h3>0.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>First public release.</li>
<li>Modified it to work as a squirrelmail plugin.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pre 0.1</h3>

<ul>
<li>It started as a standalone script, built on top of Dan Ellis' test
  scripts that come with sieve-php.lib.</li>
</ul>
