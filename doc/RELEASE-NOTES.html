<h2><a>Development Branch (1.9)</a></h2>

<p>The Devel Branch aims for some major changes, which are not considered
stable enough. In 1.9, the code has moved around and a lot of the GUI /
frontend parts have been ported to a new scheme, while other pars have been
completely rewritten.</p>


<h3>1.9.2 (&quot;The Interface Improvements Release&quot;)</h3>

<p>This release in the devel series focuses on usability and interface
enhancements.</p>

<p>Among the new features, the highlight is based on an idea and a patch by
Simon Matter: The concept of enabling and disabling rules on the fly, without
actually deleting them altogether, is introduced.</p>

<p>The descriptions of the rules, especially the &quot;terse&quot; description,
have been made more user-friendly.</p>

<p>There are more bugfixes, including a new way to encode/decode SIEVE scripts
from UTF-8 to the user's character set and vice versa. These fallback attempts
try to use iconv or recode.</p>

<p>Testing and bug reporting is much appreciated!</p>



<h3>1.9.1</h3>

<p>Welcome to another installment in the 1.9 series.</p>

<p>This release fixes some usability and business-logic bugs that slipped the
initial devel release. A fix for Dan's MANAGESIEVE class, upon which this whole
project was based, is also in. The off-by-one error could cause Apache / PHP to
get into an endless loop, until all the PHP memory limits were exhausted.
Hopefully this will make avelsieve just a bit more robust and secure.</p>

<p>Other than that, I believe that the 1.9 series is heading fast to become a
2.0 release. Before doing that, I would like to ensure compatibility with PHP5,
which means removing the hack that I've done, reasssigning '$this' in two
places of the new code.</p>

<p>At the moment nothing has changed in the way SIEVE scripts are being built.
The SIEVE scripts created are backward- and forward-compatible so far.</p>

<h3>1.9.0</h3>

<p>This is the first release of the next-gen avelsieve!</p>

<p>This release should be considered 'alpha quality'. At the moment it works
for me without any major glitches, but who knows, there might be a bug that
DoS'es the Apache Server by eating all of its memory in there. (I know there
<em>was</em> at least one of those, I fixed it some days ago).</p>

<p>Please try out the new <em>Edit Rule</em> page and report to me, or to the
squirrelmail-plugins mailing list, or to both, your annoyances, bugs and
wishes.</p>

<h2><a>Stable Branch (1.0)</a></h2>

<p>The code in this branch has practically lived as-is for enough months in
peoples' production servers that I consider it very stable and at least
soemwhat robust.</p>

<p>Some people still report that they cannot get avelsieve to remember the
rules - probably a session problem; but I can't figure out why that happens.
For most people it works without a glitch. If you find any difficulty in
getting it to work, please let me know.</p>


<h3>1.0.1</h3>

<p>This release simply incorporates the fix of the off-by-one bug in the
MANAGESIEVE class, to avoid hammering the Apache Server. Upgrading is
highly recommended.</p>

<h3>1.0</h3>

<p>Nothing much that warrants really the move from 0.9.x to 1.0, but some day
it had to be done!</p>
