<h2>Development Branch (1.9)</h2>

<p>The Devel Branch aims for some major changes, which are not considered
stable enough. In 1.9, the code has moved around and a lot of the GUI /
frontend parts have been ported to a new scheme, while other pars have been
completely rewritten.</p>

<h3>1.9</h3>

<p>This is the first release of the next-gen avelsieve!</p>

<p>This release should be considered 'alpha quality'. At the moment it works
for me without any major glitches, but who knows, there might be a bug that
DoS'es the Apache Server by eating all of its memory in there. (I know there
<em>was</em> at least one of those, I fixed it some days ago).</p>

<p>Please try out the new <em>Edit Rule</em> page and report to me, or to the
squirrelmail-plugins mailing list, or to both, your annoyances, bugs and
wishes.</p>

<h2>Stable Branch (1.0)</h2>

<p>The code in this branch has practically lived as-is for enough months in
peoples' production servers that I consider it very stable and at least
soemwhat robust.</p>

<p>Some people still report that they cannot get avelsieve to remember the
rules - probably a session problem; but I can't figure out why that happens.
For most people it works without a glitch. If you find any difficulty in
getting it to work, please let me know.</p>

<h3>1.0</h3>

<p>Nothing much that warrants really the move from 0.9.x to 1.0, but some day
it had to be done!</p>
