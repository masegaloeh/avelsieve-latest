<h3>Medium-priority Items</h3>

<ul>

<li>Support <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-degener-sieve-body-00.txt">
Sieve - body extension</a> (started partial implementation)</li>

<li>Sort out the GUI when adding a new rule. Make it more dynamic and
support mixed, complicated AND/OR logic.</li>

<li>Support multiple SIEVE scripts and switching between them.</li>

<li>Support import / export / backup of Sieve scripts.</li>

<li>Sieve scripts in shared folders, via ANNOTATEMORE as implemented in Cyrus

can be used with non-MANAGESIEVE servers such as MTAs (Exim).</li>

</ul>


<h3>Low Priority</h3>

<ul>

<li>Standalone version that does not depend on Squirrelmail.</li>

<li>Support TLS connects to timsieved, in sieve-php.lib.php.</li>

<li>Support advanced mode, so that the user can edit the SIEVE scripts directly
(if she knows SIEVE). However this will disable the nice GUI</li>

href="http://www.oceana.com/ftp/drafts/draft-segmuller-sieve-relation-01.txt">Sieve
Extension: Relational Tests</a>, the :count matchtype.</li>

soon.</li>

</ul>



<h3>Things to Check</h3>

<p>These are implemented, but they might need some more QA.</p>

<ul>

<li>Error handling when creating a folder with invalid characters etc.</li>

<li>Synchronization between folders mentioned in fileinto rules and actual
folders that exist in the Cyrus tree. - Partially implemented: a warning
message is being displayed when there is such an inconsistency.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Wishlist</h3>

<ul>

<li>Header match rule: user can put a custom header to be matched against
(editable box instead of Select).</li>

<li>Folder creation does not work while editing an existing rule.</li>

<li>Support &quot;ready-made rules&quot;, like: <em>All messages sent only to
me</em>, <em>Place emails alphabetically in folders A-M and N-Z</em>, <em>Spam
Filter</em> etc. (need ideas!)</li>

<li>Respond with mime-encoded files. Support the :mime parameter.  <a
