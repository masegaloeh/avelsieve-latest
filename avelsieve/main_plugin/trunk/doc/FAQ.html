<strong>Cyrus Sieve server (timsieved) complains about size of Sieve scripts.</strong>
<br/><br/>

Sieve scripts can get quite large, especially with the metadata that avelsieve saves together
with the script.
<br/>
In Cyrus, you are advised to make the permitted Sieve script size bigger, in imapd.conf:<br/>
<pre>
 # Maximum size (in kilobytes) any sieve script can be, enforced at
 # submission by timsieved(8).
sieve_maxscriptsize: 32
</pre>
<br/>
Changing the default size of 32 kb to 64 or 128 kb should be OK for most purposes.
